1. In Objective-C, a class is itself an object with an opaque type called Class. Classes can’t have properties defined using the declaration syntax shown earlier for instances, but they can receive messages.

2. The typical use for a class method is as a factory method.

-------- Working with Objects ------------
Address: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithObjects/WorkingwithObjects.html

1. NSLog() uses format specifiers to indicate substitution tokens, just like the C standard library printf() function.

2. The substitution token %@ used to denote an object.  At runtime, this specifier will be substituted with the result of calling either the descriptionWithLocale: method (if it exists) or the description method on the provided object. The description method is implemented by NSObject to return the class and memory address of the object, but many Cocoa and Cocoa Touch classes override it to provide more useful information. In the case of NSString, the description method simply returns the string of characters that it represents.

3. There are some memory management considerations in this situation: a returned object (created on the heap) needs to exist long enough for it to be used by the original caller of the method, but not in perpetuity because that would create a memory leak. For the most part, the Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) feature of the Objective-C compiler takes care of these considerations for you.

4. Whenever you’re writing a method implementation, you have access to an important hidden value, self.

5. There’s another important keyword available to you in Objective-C, called super.

6. Note: It’s possible for init to return a different object than was created by alloc, so it’s best practice to nest the calls as shown.

7. Never initialize an object without reassigning any pointer to that object. As     an example, don’t do this:
      NSObject *someObject = [NSObject alloc];
      [someObject init];
   If the call to init returns some other object, you’ll be left with a pointer      to the object that was originally allocated but never initialized.

8. Use new to Create an Object If No Arguments Are Needed for Initialization
  It’s also possible to create an instance of a class using the new class method.   This method is provided by NSObject and doesn’t need to be overridden in your     own subclasses.

  It’s effectively the same as calling alloc and init with no arguments:

    XYZObject *object = [XYZObject new];
    // is effectively the same as:
    XYZObject *object = [[XYZObject alloc] init];

9. Because of Objective-C’s dynamic nature, it doesn’t matter what specific class type you use for that pointer—the correct method will always be called on the relevant object when you send it a message.

10.Note: If you expect a return value from a message sent to nil, the return value will be nil for object return types, 0 for numeric types, and NO for BOOL types. Returned structures have all members initialized to zero.

-------- Encapsulating Data ------------

1. ARC: Automatic Reference Counting

2. Strong reference cycles might lead to memory leaks.

3. Use Accessor method to Get/Set Property values.

4. The synthesized methods follow specific naming conventions:

The method used to access the value (the getter method) has the same name as the property.
The getter method for a property called firstName will also be called firstName.

The method used to set the value (the setter method) starts with the word “set” and then uses the capitalized property name.

The setter method for a property called firstName will be called setFirstName:.

5. it’s possible to add an attribute on the property:
   @property (getter=isFinished) BOOL finished;
   
6. When one object relies on other objects in this way, effectively taking ownership of those other objects, the first object is said to have strong references to the other objects. In Objective-C, an object is kept alive as long as it has at least one strong reference to it from another object.

7.Local variables (and non-property instance variables) also maintain strong references to objects by default. This means that the following code will work exactly as you expect:

    NSDate *originalDate = self.lastModificationDate;
    self.lastModificationDate = [NSDate date];
    NSLog(@"Last modification date changed from %@ to %@",
                        originalDate, self.lastModificationDate);
In this example, the local variable originalDate maintains a strong reference to the initial lastModificationDate object. When the lastModificationDate property is changed, the property no longer keeps a strong reference to the original date, but that date is still kept alive by the originalDate strong variable.

Note: A variable maintains a strong reference to an object only as long as that variable is in scope, or until it is reassigned to another object or nil.

8. because in a multi-threaded application, the property may be deallocated between the test and the method call, rendering the test useless. Instead, you need to declare a strong local variable to cache the value, like this:

    NSObject *cachedObject = self.someWeakProperty;           // 1
    if (cachedObject) {                                       // 2
        [someObject doSomethingImportantWith:cachedObject];   // 3
    }                                                         // 4
    cachedObject = nil;                                       // 5
	
9. In a factory method, we can call [[self alloc]init], then we can use the object function;

10. NSMutableString cannot initialized by literal String like @"John", it should be initialized as follow:
    NSMutableString *str = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"John"];
	
-------------Ex 4--------------
1. init has to be object function instead of class function;
2. The error I have made is I used a third pointer to point to the object. Person.
3. Please see the code in Ex2 and Ex3 for the problem.
4. Try use the same test code in main with different init functions (EX2-3 and EX4), you will find where the problem is.

-----------Chapter 5: Customizing existing class ------------

1. If you need to add a method to an existing class, perhaps to add functionality to make it easier to do something in your own application, the easiest way is to use a category.

2. A category is usually declared in a separate header file and implemented in a separate source code file. In the case of XYZPerson, you might declare the category in a header file called XYZPerson+XYZPersonNameDisplayAdditions.h.

3. Categories can be used to declare either instance methods or class methods but are not usually suitable for declaring additional properties. It’s valid syntax to include a property declaration in a category interface, but it’s not possible to declare an additional instance variable in a category. This means the compiler won’t synthesize any instance variable, nor will it synthesize any property accessor methods. You can write your own accessor methods in the category implementation, but you won’t be able to keep track of a value for that property unless it’s already stored by the original class.

The only way to add a traditional property—backed by a new instance variable—to an existing class is to use a class extension, as described in Class Extensions Extend the Internal Implementation.

4. The compiler will complain if code in one of those other source code files attempts to call a private method or set a readonly property, but it’s possible to avoid compiler errors and leverage dynamic runtime features to call those methods in other ways, such as by using one of the performSelector:... methods offered by NSObject. You should avoid a class hierarchy or design where this is necessary; instead, the primary class interface should always define the correct “public” interactions.

If you intend to make “private” methods or properties available to select other classes, such as related classes within a framework, you can declare the class extension in a separate header file and import it in the source files that need it. It’s not uncommon to have two header files for a class, for example, such as XYZPerson.h and XYZPersonPrivate.h. When you release the framework, you only release the public XYZPerson.h header file.

-----------Working With Protocols--------------
1.Check that Optional Methods Are Implemented at Runtime

If a method in a protocol is marked as optional, you must check whether an object implements that method before attempting to call it.

As an example, the pie chart view might test for the segment title method like this:

    NSString *thisSegmentTitle;
    if ([self.dataSource respondsToSelector:@selector(titleForSegmentAtIndex:)]) {
        thisSegmentTitle = [self.dataSource titleForSegmentAtIndex:index];
    }
The respondsToSelector: method uses a selector, which refers to the identifier for a method after compilation. You can provide the correct identifier by using the @selector() directive and specifying the name of the method.

If the data source in this example implements the method, the title is used; otherwise, the title remains nil.

Remember: Local object variables are automatically initialized to nil.
If you attempt to call the respondsToSelector: method on an id conforming to the protocol as it’s defined above, you’ll get a compiler error that there’s no known instance method for it. Once you qualify an id with a protocol, all static type-checking comes back; you’ll get an error if you try to call any method that isn’t defined in the specified protocol. One way to avoid the compiler error is to set the custom protocol to adopt the NSObject protocol.

-------------------

1. It’s best practice to use these platform-specific types if you might be passing values across API boundaries (both internal and exported APIs), such as arguments or return values in method or function calls between your application code and a framework.

2. NSNumber is actually a class cluster. This means that when you create an instance at runtime, you’ll get a suitable concrete subclass to hold the provided value. Just treat the created object as an instance of NSNumber.

3. It’s also possible to create NSValue objects to represent custom structures. If you have a particular need to use a C structure (rather than an Objective-C object) to store information, like this:

typedef struct {
    int i;
    float f;
} MyIntegerFloatStruct;
you can create an NSValue instance by providing a pointer to the structure as well as an encoded Objective-C type. The @encode() compiler directive is used to create the correct Objective-C type, like this:

    struct MyIntegerFloatStruct aStruct;
    aStruct.i = 42;
    aStruct.f = 3.14;
 
    NSValue *structValue = [NSValue value:&aStruct
                             withObjCType:@encode(MyIntegerFloatStruct)];
The standard C reference operator (&) is used to provide the address of aStruct for the value parameter.

4. Sorting Array Objects

The NSArray class also offers a variety of methods to sort its collected objects. Because NSArray is immutable, each of these methods returns a new array containing the items in the sorted order.

As an example, you can sort an array of strings by the result of calling compare: on each string, like this:

    NSArray *unsortedStrings = @[@"gammaString", @"alphaString", @"betaString"];
    NSArray *sortedStrings =
                 [unsortedStrings sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(compare:)];

5. Although the NSArray class itself is immutable, this has no bearing on any collected objects. If you add a mutable string to an immutable array, for example, like this:

NSMutableString *mutableString = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"Hello"];
NSArray *immutableArray = @[mutableString];there’s nothing to stop you from mutating the string:

    if ([immutableArray count] > 0) {
        id string = immutableArray[0];
        if ([string isKindOfClass:[NSMutableString class]]) {
            [string appendString:@" World!"];
        }
    }
	
6.Dictionaries Collect Key-Value Pairs
Rather than simply maintaining an ordered or unordered collection of objects, an NSDictionary stores objects against given keys, which can then be used for retrieval.

It’s best practice to use string objects as dictionary keys, as shown in Figure 6-3.

------------Working with  blocks-------------
1. Note: If you attempt to invoke a block using an unassigned variable (a nil block variable), your app will crash.

2. Only the value is captured, unless you specify otherwise. This means that if you change the external value of the variable between the time you define the block and the time it’s invoked, like this:

    int anInteger = 42;
 
    void (^testBlock)(void) = ^{
        NSLog(@"Integer is: %i", anInteger);
    };
 
    anInteger = 84;
 
    testBlock();
the value captured by the block is unaffected. This means that the log output would still show:

Integer is: 42
It also means that the block cannot change the value of the original variable, or even the captured value (it’s captured as a const variable).

3. A Block Should Always Be the Last Argument to a Method

It’s best practice to use only one block argument to a method. If the method also needs other non-block arguments, the block should come last:

- (void)beginTaskWithName:(NSString *)name completion:(void(^)(void))callback;
This makes the method call easier to read when specifying the block inline, like this:

    [self beginTaskWithName:@"MyTask" completion:^{
        NSLog(@"The task is complete");
    }];
	
4. Custom type definitions are particularly useful when dealing with blocks that return blocks or take other blocks as arguments. Consider the following example:

void (^(^complexBlock)(void (^)(void)))(void) = ^ (void (^aBlock)(void)) {
    ...
    return ^{
        ...
    };
};
The complexBlock variable refers to a block that takes another block as an argument (aBlock) and returns yet another block.

Rewriting the code to use a type definition makes this much more readable:

XYZSimpleBlock (^betterBlock)(XYZSimpleBlock) = ^ (XYZSimpleBlock aBlock) {
    ...
    return ^{
        ...
    };
};

5. To avoid this problem, it’s best practice to capture a weak reference to self, like this:

- (void)configureBlock {
    XYZBlockKeeper * __weak weakSelf = self;
    self.block = ^{
        [weakSelf doSomething];   // capture the weak reference
                                  // to avoid the reference cycle
    }
}
By capturing the weak pointer to self, the block won’t maintain a strong relationship back to the XYZBlockKeeper object. If that object is deallocated before the block is called, the weakSelf pointer will simply be set to nil.

------------Work with Errors--------------
1. You should not use a try-catch block in place of standard programming checks for Objective-C methods. In the case of an NSArray, for example, you should always check the array’s count to determine the number of items before trying to access an object at a given index. The objectAtIndex: method throws an exception if you make an out-of-bounds request so that you can find the bug in your code early in the development cycle—you should avoid throwing exceptions in an app that you ship to users.

------------- Conventions -------------
1. if a method includes an error pointer parameter to be set if an error occurred, this should be the last parameter to the method. If a method takes a block, the block parameter should be the last parameter in order to make any method invocations as readable as possible when specifying a block inline. For the same reason, it’s best to avoid methods that take multiple block arguments, wherever possible.

2.Although the C language does allow you to declare a new local variable with the same name as one declared in the enclosing scope, like this:

- (void)someMethod {
    int interestingNumber = 42;
    ...
    for (NSNumber *eachNumber in array) {
        int interestingNumber = [eachNumber intValue]; // not advisable
        ...
    }
}
it makes the code confusing and less readable, so it’s best practice to avoid this wherever possible.

3. Class factory methods should always start with the name of the class (without the prefix) that they create, with the exception of subclasses of classes with existing factory methods. In the case of the NSArray class, for example, the factory methods start with array. The NSMutableArray class doesn’t define any of its own class-specific factory methods, so the factory methods for a mutable array still begin with array.

There are various memory management rules underpinning Objective-C, which the compiler uses to ensure objects are kept alive as long as necessary. Although you typically don’t need to worry too much about these rules, the compiler judges which rule it should follow based on the name of the creation method. Objects created via factory methods are managed slightly differently from objects that are created through traditional allocation and initialization or new because of the use of autorelease pool blocks. For more information on autorelease pool blocks and memory management in general, see Advanced Memory Management Programming Guide.
